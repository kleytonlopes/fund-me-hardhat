# My Sample Hardhat Project (Kleyton Lopes)

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. 
It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

The name of the contract is "FundMe".
The user can deposit funds into the contract and then withdraw it at any time.
